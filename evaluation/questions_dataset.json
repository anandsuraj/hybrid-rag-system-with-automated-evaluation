The Newtonian theory of gravity is a good approximation to the predictions of general relativity when gravitational effects are weak and objects are moving slowly compared to the speed of light.: 327 The relation between matter distribution and spacetime curvature is given by the Einstein field equations, which require tensor calculus to express.: 43 The universe appears to be a smooth spacetime continuum consisting of three spatial dimensions and one temporal (time) dimension.
